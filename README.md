# VerthashMiner_Automated
This is one of my first projects. Thanks to the Vertcoin Community for providing VerthashMiner. This intends to simplify the setup while allowing advanced logging with the VHM.
The Binary is copied from CryptoGraphics's Verthashminer. If you prefer to download it manually, the link is here: https://github.com/CryptoGraphics/VerthashMiner  
Requires Python 3.5+ to run. Thanks!

Donations are greatly appreciated!
