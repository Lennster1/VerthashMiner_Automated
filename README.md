# VerthashMiner_Automated
This program is simply a script that simplifies the expirience for mining Vertcoin. It will input the user for thier wallet adress, will save it, and automatically start hashing. 
## Notes
This is one of my first projects. A big thanks to the Vertcoin Community for allowing me to use the open source VerthashMiner, and thanks to @CryptoGraphics for coding it.  
This program uses Verthashminer as the mining software. The binaries and CL files are copied directly from @CryptoGraphics's repository. If you prefer to download the binaries manually, the link is here: https://github.com/CryptoGraphics/VerthashMiner<br>
Also, most antivirus programs flag mining software as malaware. This is normal, and simply add an expection in your AV software where the `Verthashminer_Automated` folder is.<br>
**Special thanks to D1viry and @sylvesternumski for helping me debug problems.** <br>
You can see our roadmap here: https://github.com/Lennster1/VerthashMiner_Automated/projects/1 <br>
## Instructions
To run the program, simply unzip the folder provided and open start.exe. This will automatically start the program. It will prompt you for your wallet adress. <br>
When you  enter it, it will automatically start hashing with the adress provided. If you want to see your statistics, go to `https://zergpool.com/?address=YOUR_ADRESS_HERE` and replace `YOUR_ADRESS_HERE` with the wallet adress you inputted into the program/
